# Calories Burnt Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the calories burnt during physical activities based on user data such as age, gender, weight, and other biometric and activity-related features. By leveraging machine learning, the model identifies patterns and provides accurate predictions to enhance fitness tracking and calorie management.

## Key Features

- **Machine Learning Model:** Implements regression models to predict calorie burn.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Uses biometric and activity data to train the model for precise outcomes.
- **End-to-End Pipeline:** Includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- **Insights for Fitness Tracking:** Helps users manage their fitness goals by providing accurate calorie estimates.

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection:**
   - The dataset includes features like age, gender, height, weight, and activity duration.
   - Activity-specific metrics such as heart rate are also considered.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Scales numerical features, and encodes categorical variables.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Employs regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, etc.) to train the model.
   - Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize model performance.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluates the model using metrics like R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Models Used

- **Linear Regression:**
  - Provides a baseline model for calorie prediction.

- **Ridge Regression:**
  - Regularization improves the model's ability to generalize on unseen data.

- **Comparison:**
  - Performance of various models is compared to select the best one for deployment.
